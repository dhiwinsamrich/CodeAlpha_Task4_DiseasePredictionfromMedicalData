# Disease Prediction from Medical Data

## Project Overview
üöÄ Thrilled to Share My Latest Internship Project at CodeAlpha! üöÄ

I'm excited to present one of the most impactful projects I worked on during my internship at CodeAlpha!

### Disease Prediction from Medical Data

üìä **Project Title:** Disease Prediction from Medical Data

In this project, I developed a predictive model to determine the likelihood of various diseases based on medical data, including symptoms and patient history. This project holds great potential for improving early diagnosis and personalized healthcare.

## Project Highlights
üåü **Project Highlights:**
- **Objective:** Predict the likelihood of diseases using medical data to aid in early diagnosis and treatment.
- **Data Used:** Labeled medical records encompassing patient history, symptoms, and other relevant medical data.
- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Methodology
üîç **Methodology:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and normalized the medical data to ensure accuracy.
   - Managed missing values and encoded categorical variables.
2. **Feature Selection:** 
   - Identified key features influencing disease prediction to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Applied cross-validation to ensure robustness.
   - Evaluated each model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
